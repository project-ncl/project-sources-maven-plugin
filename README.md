# Simpler `project.[zip|tar.gz]` (Source Archive) Production

This plugin simply wraps an invocation of the Maven Assembly Plugin's built-in `project` assembly, which creates archives containing a buildable project directory. It is basically an archive of your project's root directory without including any of the files created when the build runs.

This plugin was created to make the creation of project-sources archives as simple as declaring a plugin execution with a single goal and no configuration whatsoever. One handy side effect is that it also allows tools to inject project-sources creation into project POMs without affecting pre-existing assembly plugin executions.

## `m2eclipse` Ignores this Plugin

As of the 1.0 release, this plugin includes a `META-INF/m2e/lifecycle-mapping-metadata.xml` file that tells m2eclipse to ignore it when Eclipse rebuilds your project.

## Usage

It's a pretty simple configuration:

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.jboss.pnc</groupId>
      <artifactId>project-sources-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${projectSrcVersion}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>project-sources</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>archive</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>

### Disabling from the Command Line

If you find that you need to disable this plugin for a specific build, you can use the `-Dproject.src.skip=true` command-line option.

### Changing source archive root folder

To create source archive with root folder myFolderName

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.jboss.pnc</groupId>
      <artifactId>project-sources-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${projectSrcVersion}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>project-sources</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>archive</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
      <configuration>
        <assemblyRootFolder>myFolderName</assemblyRootFolder>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>

### Specify source archive format(s)

By default source archive format is "tar.gz". Use "formats" configuration option to specify different or additional formats (see https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/single-mojo.html#formats )
Formats are comma separated.

Eg. to generate tar.gz and zip format

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.jboss.pnc</groupId>
      <artifactId>project-sources-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${projectSrcVersion}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>project-sources</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>archive</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
      <configuration>
        <formats>tar.gz, zip</formats>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
